# LeetCode-Explanations-and-Solutions
This repository contains various Leetcode problems that highlight valuable algorithms and data structures

## Language:

All code is provided in Java and my own personal Pseduo Code allowing for easy translation of these solutions to any target language.

## Tags:

These notes originally come from an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) notebook and may contain internal links and tags such as [[]] or the "#" symbol or the tags at the top of every document. If you add these to your own obsidian notebook, problems will link together in the graph based on similar data structures, algorithms, time complexity, space complexity, difficulty, and more.

Keep cycle set for visiting, any cycle means false no valid path. | [Markdown Solution](210.Course-Schedule-II/Solution.md) | Topological_Sort, Graph, DFS, O_n2, O_n2space, Medium, HashMap, HashSet |
| [2642. Design Graph With Shortest Path Calculator](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-graph-with-shortest-path-calculator/description/) | Store the graph as an adjacency map, when called for the shortest path, run Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm between the two nodes, explained in solution. | [Markdown Solution](2642.Design-Graph-With-Shortest-Path-Calculator/Solution.md) | Dijkstra, Graph, ObjectCreation, customComparator, Heap, HashMap, O_n2, O_n2space, Hard, Greedy |
| [779. K-th Symbol in Grammar](https://leetcode.com/problems/k-th-symbol-in-grammar/description/) | Run a directed DFS the height of the graph making a decision to go right or left at each node, inverting the value when going right. | [Markdown Solution](779.Kth-Symbol-in-Grammar/Solution.md) | DFS, traversal, TwoPointer, O_n, O_1space, Medium, BinarySearch |
| [2050. Parallel Courses III](https://leetcode.com/problems/parallel-courses-iii/description/) | Find the longest continuous path in the graph formed by the prereq edges and adding the time to take each course at every node. DFS at every course and store the result in a DP table of index node. | [Markdown Solution](2050.Parallel-Courses-III/Solution.md) | 1D_DP, DFS, Graph, HashMap, O_n2, O_n2space, Hard, Recursive |
| [1361. Validate Binary Tree Nodes](https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-binary-tree-nodes/) | First find the node that is not the child of any other node, that is the root. Then run BFS/DFS on the tree starting at the root, ensure no cycles or nodes with multiple parents with a visited set. Return that the visited set is size `n` | [Markdown Solution](1361.Validate-Binary-Tree-Nodes/Solution.md) | BinaryTree, BFS, HashSet, Queue, cycleDetection, O_n, O_nspace, Medium |
| [1793. Maximum Score of a Good Subarray](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-score-of-a-good-subarray/) | Start left and right pointers at element k, while you can expand to a new element, expand to whichever is greater/will hurt the score least (same condition). Calculate local score and keep track of global max score to return. | [Markdown Solution](1793.Maximum-Score-of-a-Good-Subarray/Solution.md) | TwoPointer, O_n, O_1space, Hard |
|  [341. Flatten Nested List Iterator](https://leetcode.com/problems/flatten-nested-list-iterator/description/)|  Run a DFS on the nested ints unpacking every value and adding every list back to the stack in reverse order, add all ints to a queue. Return next element of the queue/ if queue is empty | [Markdown Solution](341.Flatten-Nested-List-Iterator/Solution.md) | ObjectCreation, CustomInterface, Stack, Queue, DFS, O_n, O_nspace, Medium |
| [1143. Longest Common Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-subsequence/) | 2D-DP array, Compare every character in one string to every character in the other. If they are equal, subsequence is 1 plus the subsequence at the two characters before. Otherwise take the max of deleting either of the current characters | [Markdown Solution](1143.Longest-Common-Subsequence/Solution.md) |  2D_DP, Subsequence, O_mxn, O_mxnspace, Medium, |
| [62. Unique Paths](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths/) | Initialize there is one way to get the origin. Explore the entire 2D grid normally, way to get to square `(i, j)` is the ways to get to the square to the left `(i - 1, j)` plus the square above `(i, j - 1)` if they are valid.
